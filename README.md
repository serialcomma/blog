# Serial Comma Blog

This repository is for the Jekyll files and content for the Serial Comma blog.

The Jekyll files are forked from the [Agusmakmun](https://agusmakmun.github.io) theme.

## Key Changes to the Jekyll Theme

My changes to the base theme have so far been principally related to typography and to things like footer text.

* Changed the dominant color to purple from green
* Changed the fonts
* Changed font sizes and colors to improve legibility
* Added an option to have a hero image for posts; this seems to have been anticipated but not implemented
* Added styles to support images embedded in posts
* Added styles to support captions for images

I haven't changed the layouts in any material way.

You're welcome to use the Jekyll code in whatever way you see fit, subject to the LICENSE. I'm not making the copyright in the content freely available, however.
