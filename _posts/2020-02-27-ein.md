The consensus advice when forming a new company is to apply for a tax ID number sooner rather than later. Although I do not plan to have any revenues for another couple of years, I thought it was best to get this detail out of the way, particularly as I am currently based outside the US and I didn't know how long the process would take from overseas.

I needn't have worried. The IRS has a very efficient [online process](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/apply-for-an-employer-identification-number-ein-online) for issuing Employer Identification Numbers (EINs). There are only two basic eligibility requirements:

* You may apply for an EIN online if your principal business is located in the United States or U.S. Territories.
  
* The person applying online must have a valid Taxpayer Identification Number (SSN, ITIN, EIN).

The online application only took a few minutes to complete. The confirmation of receipt of the application and the issuance of the EIN were in my email inbox a few minutes later.
