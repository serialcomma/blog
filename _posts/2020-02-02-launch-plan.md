I'm making up the launch plan as I go and everything is subject to change, but here is my current thinking:

1. Decide on the company name
   
2. Create the logo

3. Form the company

    a. Incorporate

    b. Get a tax ID number

4. Create a design system
   
    a. Typography

    b. Colors

    c. Spacing

    d. Components

5. Implement an accounting system
   
6. Develop the business model

    a. Market research

    b. Write the service description

    c. Determine pricing

7. Develop the main website

8. Figure out what's next

I'll update this as appropriate.
