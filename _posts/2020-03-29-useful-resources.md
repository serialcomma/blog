Credible, focused, concise information can be hard to find online. When you have a question, you want to find the right answer quickly and return to your primary task. During my learning journey (which continues as intensely as ever), I have found the resources listed below to be helpful.

I use a MacBook Pro for my development work. If you use a PC you will need to find Windows equivalents for some of the tools and resources I've referenced here. If you use Linux you are likely far beyond the level of this post already.

## Search Engine

[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com)

You may be surprised at my choice. While Google has created many useful tools and their search engine is undoubtedly the best, I have reluctantly concluded their use of the information they collect about you is irredeemably evil. DuckDuckGo does not collect your personal info or track you. I have found their answer sets to be on par with Google's. I suggest you try DuckDuckGo and make it your default search engine on your computer, phone, and tablet.

## Apple

[macOS command line commands](https://ss64.com/osx/)

I admit I had no idea there are so many macOS commands. You will probably only use a fraction of them, but when you need to see if there is a command to do X, this is a good place to start.

If you know the command you want to use but need to know the syntax of its options, it can be quicker to use the `man` (manual) command while in your terminal program. For example, if you want information on the `ls` command, type `man ls` and `enter`, then press the `spacebar` to page through the entry for that command. You can type `q` to quit and return to the command line.
